# 🍎🍌🍊 Smart Fruit Ripeness Grading System
A Computer Vision–Based Fruit Quality Classification System

This repository contains the Streamlit implementation of the Smart Fruit Ripeness Grading System, an AI-powered computer vision application developed for the BSD3513 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence – Group Project.

The system uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to analyse uploaded fruit images and automatically classify their ripeness into three intuitive grades:

- 🟢 Grade 1 – Unripe / Fresh

- 🟡 Grade 2 – Ripe

- 🔴 Grade 3 – Overripe / Rotten

The objective of this project is to demonstrate how computer vision and deep learning can be applied to food quality assessment, supporting better daily decision-making such as fruit consumption, storage, or disposal.

## 🔍 Application Features

In this application, you will find:

- 📷 Image-based fruit ripeness classification using computer vision

- 🍌🍎🍊 Support for banana, apple, and orange images

- 🧠 CNN-based prediction model trained on labelled fruit datasets

- 🎯 Grade-based output system for easy interpretation:

  - 🟢 Grade 1 – Unripe / Fresh

  - 🟡 Grade 2 – Ripe

  - 🔴 Grade 3 – Overripe / Rotten

- 📊 Prediction confidence visualisation to improve transparency

- 🖼️ Visual grade reference images to assist user understanding

- 🎨 Simple and user-friendly Streamlit interface

The system abstracts complex model predictions into easy-to-understand ripeness grades, making it suitable for non-technical users.

## 🧠 Methodology Overview

The system follows a straightforward computer vision workflow:

1. The user uploads one or multiple fruit images

2. Images are preprocessed and analysed by a CNN model

3. The model predicts fruit ripeness-related classes

4. Predicted classes are mapped into three ripeness grades

5. Results are displayed with confidence scores and visual references

This approach balances model accuracy, interpretability, and usability, which is essential for real-world AI applications.

## ⚠️ Project Scope & Limitations

The system is designed only for banana, apple, and orange images

- Predictions for other fruit types may be unreliable

- Model performance may be affected by:

  - Lighting conditions

  - Image quality

  - Background noise

These limitations are common and acceptable in machine learning–based computer vision systems.
